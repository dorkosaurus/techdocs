## Variable naming

Naming a Variable

You've learned how to make a valid function name. In this section, let's focus on naming variables. Function names and variable names are both identifiers in C.

The following are all the characters you can use to make a valid variable name:

Characters A through Z and a through z.
Digit characters 0 through 9, which can be used in any position except the first of a variable name.
The underscore character (_).
For instance, stop_sign, Loop3, and _pause are all valid variable names.

Now, let's see what you cannot use in variable naming:

A variable name cannot contain any C arithmetic signs.
A variable name cannot contain any dots (.).
A variable name cannot contain any apostrophes (`).
A variable name cannot contain any other special symbols such as *, @, #, ?, and so on.
Some invalid variable names, for example, are, 4flags, sum-result, method*4, and what_size?.
